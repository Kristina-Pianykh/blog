Hey there! :wave:

My name is Kris and this is the log (for the lack of a better word) of my thoughts on topics around programming, as well as my personal journey in the tech world. This is no blog by any means and more of a space to formulate my opinions without any implications otherwise heavily associated with the social media platforms like LinkedIn or Twitter.

Join me on this ride:sparkles:
